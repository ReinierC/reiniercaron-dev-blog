    Hi,

    I'm Reinier and I have a graving for webdevelopment. To shed a light on my
    path towards greater development knowledge I've created this blog.
    Hope you'll find some interesting reads...
intro:
  heading: Why?
  text: >-
    Why should you even consider reading this rather personal blog?




    Your wondering if I'm that missing webdeveloper your looking for.




    Sometimes it's fun to see what tech other developers like.




    I've asked you to read it in exchange for a bribe.

      2017 has been a good year for front-end development. The official arrival
      of CSS Grid sure was a great experience for me. It changed my  dependency
      on bloated frameworks for quickly developing one pagers and the likes.

      Some funny dude told me:
      "The ozone layer or chees in a spraycan, don't
      make me choose."  


      What I thought was: "HTML5 or Markdown-language, don't make me choose." -->
