      2017 has been a good year for front-end development. The official arrival
      of CSS Grid sure was a great experience for me. It changed my  dependency
      on bloated frameworks for quickly developing one pagers and the likes.

      Some funny dude told me:
      "The ozone layer or chees in a spraycan, don't
      make me choose."  


      What I thought was: "HTML5 or Markdown-language, don't make me choose."

    Due to social and digital developments, the demand for ICT professionals greatly outnumbers the current supply. Future growth in demand is likely. Many companies find themselves struggling to fill open ICT vacancies, even failing to find suitable professionals at all. Shortage of ICT staff often impacts business performance and innovation directly. There's fierce competition between companies looking to hire new talent.

    CodeGorilla has a mission: retraining people that show potential to become ICT professionals
